# CanonicalExpression
Canonical expressions are a kind of binary expressions used especially in the implicative calculus of propositions

The theory of canonical expressions is describe in a paper : Pierres Lescanne "Zaionc paradox revisited" (to be published)

This repository contains three Haskell programs
1. Constants.hs contains pecomputed values for Stam algorithm for randomly generating restricted growth strings
2. CanonicalExpression.hs contains several functions for binary trees, restricted growth strings and canonical expressions
3. MainCanonicalExpression.hs contains utilities for building programs running in background
